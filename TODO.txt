TODO:
- Make library (sfe.dll / libsfe.so)
- Makefile / configure
- Merge MinGW and UNIX projects together as targets in Code::Blocks
- Compatibility for various compilers/IDEs (GNU GCC/G++, Dev-C++, MS Visual Studio, Android Studio, Open Watcom)
- More sense to program class inheritance
- When paused, don't run mainloop but sleep until event (no CPU load while paused)
- Threading
- Support (not mandatory) for DirectX and OpenGL/GLES routines (polygon drawing, 3D acceleration etc.)
- Support for MS-DOS and Android operating systems
- Support for some gaming consoles (PlayStation, Xbox etc.)
- Render demo/game into video file
- Separate graphics engine and control client programs
- Video editor style demo/game creator studio, similar to Unity and Demopaja
- Realtime video/audio input (camera, microphone, TV receiver, video file etc.)
- Support for augmented reality and VR goggles
- Simplify / re-design relation between Grapher, Display and SDL
- Documentation
- Support for multiple displays (like, demo running on big screen and settings panel on monitor)
- Polar coordinate plane (angle and radius)
- Camera
- Vector graphics file support (.SVG)
- Exception handling
- Networking (TCP/IP and serial port cable)
- Better keyboard handling routines
- Save and load state (for games) with recording and replay, rewind, fast forward
- Close files after loading content
- Configuration options in a file with a settings / launcher GUI
- Enum vs. #define
- Separate example programs into sub folders
- Generate textures according to resolution and aspect ratio instead of static size / scaling
- React to events (quit) immediately, don't wait for mainloop / screen refresh
- Transition effects:
	- fade in/out
	- pixelize
	- bar sweep
	- frame sweep
	- circle window
	- pixel explode/implode
	- burn away
	- roll away like paper
	- break to shards like a glass window

FIX BUGS:
- Possible memory leaks
- Deleting some objects gives a segfault
- FPS counter and limiter is inaccurate (milliseconds and integers)
- Optimization flag -O3 breaks font loading in RocketZ (has worked before)

OPTIMIZE / FINETUNE:
- Get rid of unneccessary pointers and use them when unneccessary object copying happening
- Check that all non-streamable files are closed after reading
- Better font/text drawing
